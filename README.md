#iTunes2SD (and Android)

##FAQ

###Where can I copy the files to
You can copy the files anywhere where there is a directory. The basic folder structure however is created with Android in mind, so that you could just copy all the files to your Music directory on Android and – provided your music app can read playlist files – should be able to "import" your library from iTunes.

###Can I run this on Linux?
Since iTunes2SD only relies on the XML file exported from iTunes, it is in theory possible to run this app on linux. However, your files also need to be in the correct location for the app to find them. Give it a try and if it doesn't work, let me know.
